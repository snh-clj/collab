(defn four-clojure-77
  "https://www.4clojure.com/problem/77 -- Anagram Finder

  Difficulty: medium

  Write a function which finds all the anagrams in a vector of
  words. A word x is an anagram of word y if all the letters in x can
  be rearranged in a different order to form y. Your function should
  return a set of sets, where each sub-set is a group of words which
  are anagrams of each other. Each sub-set should have at least two
  words. Words without any anagrams should not be included in the
  result."

  Difficulty: hard

  A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest
  palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91

  Difficulty: hard
  Topics: set-theory

  Write a function which generates the transitive closure
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_closure ) of a binary
  relation ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation ). The

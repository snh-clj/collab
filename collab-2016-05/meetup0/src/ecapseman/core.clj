(defn four-clojure-77
  "https://www.4clojure.com/problem/77 -- Anagram Finder

  Difficulty: medium

  Write a function which finds all the anagrams in a vector of
  words. A word x is an anagram of word y if all the letters in x can
  be rearranged in a different order to form y. Your function should
  return a set of sets, where each sub-set is a group of words which
  are anagrams of each other. Each sub-set should have at least two
  words. Words without any anagrams should not be included in the
  result."

;;
;; Difficulty: medium
;;
;; Write a function which finds all the anagrams in a vector of
;; words. A word x is an anagram of word y if all the letters in x can
;; be rearranged in a different order to form y. Your function should
;; return a set of sets, where each sub-set is a group of words which
;; are anagrams of each other. Each sub-set should have at least two
;; words. Words without any anagrams should not be included in the
;; result.

# Southern New Hampshire Clojure Meetup Collaboration Repo

## General Notes

Each collaboration event has a series of directories named in the
format `meetup?`. The `meetup0` directory is a base directory used to
seed the per-group directories named `meetup1` through `meetup9`.

`current-collab` is a symlink pointing to the current collaboration activity.

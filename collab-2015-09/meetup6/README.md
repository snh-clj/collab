# SNH-CLJ: Bonus Round!

Congratulations — You made it to the bonus round!

In our previous collaboration events we’ve had at least one problem (the boss at
the end of the level) that none of the teams conquered. Tonight is our night to
triumph!

## What's In Here

There are three Clojure[Script] projects in this repo.

1. `bonus-round` is a purely-CLJ collection of the most involved collaboration
   problems from past meetups.
1. `cljs-cli` is a copy of the collaboration repo from January, 2015, and is
   a fully-functioning CLJS application with a CLI interface, configured to
   query the RottenTomatoes API. We kept this one separate because it has `lein
   figwheel` set up with front and back-end support.
1. `test-check` is a copy of the collaboration repo from June, 2015, and is
   focused on generative testing.

## What To Do Next

Check out `bonus-round/src/bonus_round/core.clj` and `cljs-cli/README.md`, and
pick a collaborative problem or task that strikes your fancy. Don't hesitate to
_be_ fancy...it may take all of your wilyest wiles to defeat these level-ending
Bad Guys.

## More options!

Check out https://github.com/snh-clj/collab/blob/master/README.md, a master-list
of all our collaborations in the past. Feel free to pull in any pieces of those
that strike your fancy, complete tasks, riff and try new stuff, etc.

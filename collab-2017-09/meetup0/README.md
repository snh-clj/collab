## 4Colojure problems

`src/sn/core.clj` contains a set of selected collaboration problems
collected from 4Clojure (http://www.4clojure.com/). Select the
problems that are most interesting to your group and see if you can
solve them!

   * No need to do them all
   * No need to start from the top (the last one sounds interesting... you
may want to go straight to it!)
   * Don't use the built-in functions listed under "Special
     restrictions".

## Usage

1. Open `src/sn/core.clj` and `test/sn/core_test.clj` in your favorite editor to begin.
2. You can run `lein test` on the command line to see whether your solutions are correct.
3. If you wish to test only one solution, specify the test name. E.g.: `lein test :only sn.core-test/four-clojure-95-test`.

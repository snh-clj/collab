# relatable-logic

This is a set of collaboration exercises to demonstrate
logic/relational programming using core.logic, core.logic.fd,
core.logic.pldb, and Datomic datalog.

## Usage

Bring up a convenient REPL, and open the following files in your
favorite editor:

1. ```src/relatable_logic/core.clj```
1. ```test/relatable_logic/core_test.clj```

Feel free to look around, or jump right in by running ```lein test```
to see what's broken or incomplete and then fix it! Be creative --
most problems have "easy" fixes available, but experimentation is
encouraged (even if you need to change the tests).

If you finish all the problems or, if it strikes your fancy, feel free
to implement non-relational (normal) Clojure solutions alongside the
relational solutions provided.
